# Responsive Web Application

Simple web application using the Node.js framework, illustrating the client-server paradigm to submit and display film reviews stored in a MongoDB Backend. The different components are implemented via Docker containers, with Nginx integrated into the application to eliminate custom port mappings and handle reverse proxy and load balancing.

## TO RUN

## Web Application
 ```sh
>> git clone https://github.com/LizMcLaughlin/Responsive_Web_Application_Example
>> 
>> docker-compose up
```

Open in Browser at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

*Enter username 'Liz' prior to submitting new film reviews.*

## Mobile App

Once the above is up and running, you can view a simulation of an iphone application connecting to the server. Film ratings submitted via the iphone app can be viewed from the web side, and vice verse via the MongoDB backend. 

 ```sh
>> unzip mobileApp.zip
```

Open in Xcode and click 'play' (triangle) button or 'command R' (Mac) to run/test the simulator.
